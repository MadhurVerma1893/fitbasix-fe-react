                  general information and entertainment purposes only, so,
                  before starting this or any other fitness program, you should
                  consult your GP or other health care professional to determine
                  if it is right for you. If they advise against it, do not
                  start the fitness program. If you experience faintness,
                  dizziness, pain or shortness of breath at any time while
                  exercising you should stop immediately and seek medical
                  advice. The physical activities demonstrated on the App
                  naturally carry certain inherent risks including personal
                  injury. You recognize that you undertake these activities

                  medical professional prior to beginning or modifying any diet

                  activities. It's never OK to encourage violence or attack
                  anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex,
                  gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious
                  affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is
                  being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may
                  allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your
                  intent clearly. Serious threats of harm to public and personal
                  safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of
                  physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and
                  other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats
                  and consider many things when determining whether a threat is
                  credible.

              are in UAE Dirhams and are, except as described in this agreement,

              Customer specifies at the time of purchase. Customer authorizes
              FITBASIX to charge all sums for the Services Customer selects, to
              that payment method. If Customer pays any fees with a credit card,
              FITBASIX may seek pre-authorization of Customer’s credit card
              account prior to Customer’s purchase to verify that the credit
              card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to

              payments or Customer’s account, all accrued sums on or before the
