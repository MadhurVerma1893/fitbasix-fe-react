                  general information and entertainment purposes only, so,
                  before starting this or any other fitness program, you should
                  consult your GP or other health care professional to determine
                  if it is right for you. If they advise against it, do not
                  start the fitness program. If you experience faintness,
                  dizziness, pain or shortness of breath at any time while
                  exercising you should stop immediately and seek medical
                  advice. The physical activities demonstrated on the App
                  naturally carry certain inherent risks including personal
                  injury. You recognize that you undertake these activities

                  medical professional prior to beginning or modifying any diet
